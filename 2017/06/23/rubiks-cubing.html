      <h1>Rubiks Cubing</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I purchased rubiks cubes from Amazon for my brother and one of my friends for this
past Christmas.
They weren&#8217;t official Rubik&#8217;s brand cubes, they were stickerless because I figured they&#8217;d last longer.
Since they were cheap, I figured I&#8217;d buy one for myself as well.
I&#8217;d seen people at work playing with them and discussing 'algorithms' for solving.
This was always interesting to me, but I guess I never tried playing with one until I bought those
cubes for Christmas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After they arrived, I found a few websites explaining the basic algorithm and slowly memorized it.
It took a few weeks on and off playing with it for a few minutes a day, so it&#8217;s not that bad at all
(and if you dedicated more time to it, much less time would be needed).
However, after my friend came over one day, that changed everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He showed me that he had learned the basic algorithm as well, but found out about some shortcuts
he saw on youtube.
He was able to solve the cube much faster than me using those shortcuts.
Now, at the time, I wasn&#8217;t really aware of 'speed cubing', I just learned the basic algorithm and
assumed that speed cubers were using the same steps, but just had muscle memory and lots of practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After seeing him solve the cube so fast (in like 4 minutes, as opposed to my 5 minute times),
I started googling.
On youtube, there are tons of videos of people solving cubes in like 20 seconds.
I found the Fridritch (CFOP) method, which had some similarities to the basic method, but had
tons of smaller algorithms to handle different cases.
I was scared off by the daunting amount of algorithms needed for one-look OLL and one-look PLL,
so decided to start off with the Petrus method.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="other_methods">Other methods</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I thought this would be much better for me since it doesn&#8217;t require as much algorithms, instead
relying on a lot of block building and intuition.
Unfortunately for me, I had no intuition at this point, and I had a hard time building blocks.
I couldn&#8217;t easily figure out how to maneuver pieces when limited to only turning specific faces.
I tried this for a week or so, and eventually gave up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried the Roux method and then ZZ method next, still scared off from CFOP by the sheer number of
algorithms to memorize.
Both of these still required intuition that I just didn&#8217;t have, and I eventually gave up on these
as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="on_to_fridritch">On to Fridritch</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, I gave up on these other methods, and figured I&#8217;d just start memorizing algorithms.
I figured if it got too hard, maybe I just wouldn&#8217;t get into speed cubing.
I started off with a 4-look OLL/PLL (2 look each).
This is a minimal set of algorithms needed to be able to solve the cube, although it&#8217;s not as
efficient.
I&#8217;m still at 4-look, trying to learn all the PLLs, but even then, I feel like I&#8217;m doing well
(my average is about 60 seconds now, which is a lot better than 5 minutes!).
In the end, for me, I think Fridritch is a good next step from the basic method, because it helps
give you some structure.
Additionally, each time you learn a new set of algorithms, you can handle different cases or do
things more efficiently, so you feel like you&#8217;re improving, even if your times don&#8217;t get faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would first start off with the 4-look OLL/PLL algorithms.
At first keeping a printout with me, I eventually decided to keep a small pocket notebook, which
I draw in and take notes with.
I&#8217;ll usually grab 2 or 3 algorithms to learn at a time.
Any algorithms I&#8217;m trying to learn, I draw them in, and write notes in there:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name (I make up pet names for the algorithms to remember them by)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>examples) up fish OLL, down fish OLL, bow tie OLL, git merge PLL, 7 PLL</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Drawing of cube configuration for pattern recognition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrows showing where pieces will move</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithm itself</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I write the algorithm grouped into smaller sets of movements to make it easier to memorize</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Notes to myself for pattern recognition, etc.</p>

</ul>

<td class="content">
When choosing a few algorithms, it can make a difference which ones you choose!
Some algorithms are the inverse of others.
Try this out by performing an algorithm on a solved cube first to see how things move around.
There may be a matching algorithm which reverses it.
For example, there is a PLL which moves 3 edge pieces clockwise.
There is another which moves 3 edges counter-clockwise.
If you work on both of these together, you can start with a solved cube, perform one, and then
do the inverse to get back to a solved cube.
This way you learn 2 algorithms simultaneously, and you can get some pattern recognition in.
I call these 'Katas'.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I try to practice for a few minutes each day.
Usually at work I&#8217;ll time myself at least 3 times during lunch.
Other times when there&#8217;s a good pause, like running a full test suite, running rake tasks, etc.
I can usually get a couple of practice runs in here and there.
I think it&#8217;s important to practice with a timer&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;timing myself forces me to perform
algorithms under a little bit of pressure.
This helps me learn them because when I mess up, it becomes clear which things give me problems.
I like to use the rubiks timer page on ruwix.com.</p>

I bought a GANS 356 Air cube, which is not as noisy as some other cubes.
Since I use this at work and don&#8217;t want to disturb others around me, this lets me practice at lunch
without worrying about the noise as much.

<h3 id="other_techniques">Other techniques</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When trying to shave seconds off my time,
I realized I was taking too long on the white cross and F2L.
Googling these, you can find advanced techniques specifically used to speed these up as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, performing a relative white cross saves a lot of wasted movement.
I had read that setting up the white cross should only take about 6-8 moves.
At the time, I was trying to line up the white edges in order, and started counting moves.
I was using something like 15-20 and couldn&#8217;t figure out how people were shaving it down to 6-8.
After reading about relative white cross, it made perfect sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trying to speed up F2L is what ultimately started teaching me intuition.
I think learning how to move pieces around without messing up others is what did it.
I could probably try to start learning some of those other methods I tried earlier which use block building,
but I plan to avoid those for now until I at least get to 1 look PLL.</p>
