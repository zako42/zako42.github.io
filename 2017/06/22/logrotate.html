      <h1>Logrotate and MySQL</h1>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="log_rotation">Log Rotation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At work we use the community edition of MySQL 5.7.x. server (not the enterprise version).
They take security pretty seriously at work, so we have to lock things down a lot manually.
Without getting too much into all that,
we have requirements that force us to keep the MySQL General log always turned on.
This might be surprising or shocking to some, and yes we do take a performance hit,
but hey that&#8217;s a requirement for us.
As you may know, the general log captures <em>every query</em> performed by the database.
In other words, <strong>it gets huge</strong>.
Our application is not that large, not a lot of users (it&#8217;s an internal application)
but our log grows by multiple GB per day.
To avoid filling up <code>/var/log</code> or wherever the general log is configured to reside, the logs
must be rotated and compressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rhel6_logrotate">RHEL6 logrotate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use RHEL6 for our db server.
The installation of MySQL 5.7 on RHEL provides a logrotate script which can perform
the log rotation daily.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
This is not the version of MySQL which is included in the default RPM repos.
(For RHEL6, it uses MySQL 5.1&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;We wanted 5.7, so we installed the RPMs from Oracle&#8217;s website)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For RHEL6, you can put logrotate scripts in <code>/etc/logrotate.d/your-script</code>.
Those scripts get called by logrotate in <code>cron.daily</code>.
The logrotate script that came with the default installation was commented out.
But even if you uncommented everything, it was only set to rotate the mysqld log, not the general log.
To get the logrotate script to rotate the general log, I copied the config in <code>/etc/logrotate.d/mysqld</code>
and created a new entry for 'mysql_general'.
In there, I made sure to rotate daily, with compression to save disk space.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="troubleshooting_log_rotation">Troubleshooting log rotation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run the logrotate command manually, it will perform the rotation on your logs,
which may not be desirable.
To perform a dry run which doesn&#8217;t actually make changes to files, you can use the debug mode</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>note that you can run an individual log rotation script instead of using the main one in <code>/etc/logrotate.conf</code>
but since settings in individual scripts may be inheriting settings from there,
I would suggest trying that first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing you can look at is the logrotate status at <code>/var/lib/logrotate.status</code>.
The last rotation date is kept in there for each log which logrotate knows about.
This is what it uses to know whether it&#8217;s time to rotate a log.
You can see this by doing a dry run with the <code>-d</code> flag as shown above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example say you set a logrotation for daily. If you do a dry run,
and the results show that a log does not need rotating,
you can edit the datestamp in the logrotate status file to a couple of days ago.
If you perform a dry run again, it <em>should</em> now show that the log needs to be rotated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="selinux">SELinux</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When troubleshooting I found out what my problem was:
I had configured my MySQL general log to reside in <code>/var/lib/mysql/</code>, and SELinux had policies
which prevented logrotation and syslog from running in directories other than <code>/var/log</code>.
I had configured the general log to be saved in <code>/var/lib/mysql</code> when I didn&#8217;t know any better,
and not knowing where I should put the logs, I figured keeping them in the MySQL&#8217;s home directory
would be safe.
After moving the logs to <code>/var/log</code> they started getting rotated.</p>
