      <h1>Apache Too many open files</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache ran into problems where the user was not able to connect to the site.
In the ssl error log, there were errors complaining of "too many open files".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apparently, apache was opening a large amount of files due to a bunch of machine requests from
an external application which we share data with.
It looked like they were hitting an xml feed every couple of seconds,
and as a result there were a lot of open sockets going between apache and thin (our application
server).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The apache user was set to have a limit of 1024 max open files.
To fix the problem, we upped that to 16384 and are monitoring to see what happens.
The team that manages the external application will have to be contacted to inform them they
need to cut themselves back a bit.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a system wide setting and a user level setting which specifies various resources that
processes are given when they startup.
The system wide setting looks like it can be read at</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another file where individual users can be configured more granularly in <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>.
Here, a user (or group) can set their max file limit by adding an entry</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a bunch of articles that show up if you google 'apache too many open files'.
Some of the articles take wild guesses at values to set.
In our case we didn&#8217;t want to go nuts,
but we also didn&#8217;t want to increase the value by such a small amount that the problem would
just happen again the next day.
We settled on 16384, and will monitor for any re-occurance of the problem.
If it happens again we will probably double the value.
So far, it&#8217;s been a week and things have run without problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This problem could also presumably manifest itself in a DoS type of attack.
If we find any good methodology for setting these numbers, I&#8217;ll try and remember to revisit
this post.</p>
