      <h1>Beginning F2L Lookahead</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m almost done learning all the PLLs (just a few more to go!)
I decided the next thing I should focus on is improving F2L times.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="f2l_improvement">F2L Improvement</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not sure yet what I will start with. For now I will concentrate on finishing up the PLLs
and practicing those for a while, just to make sure they&#8217;ve become ingrained.
I still mess up and forget things every so often, so I definitely need more practice.
Looking ahead (heheh) to possible areas for F2L improvement, I&#8217;m thinking of 3 things</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="lookahead">Lookahead</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My coworker Chris is currently trying to work on his lookahead.
I hadn&#8217;t really thought about that, but when I looked it up, there are tons of people
saying that it&#8217;s one of the main things that helps improve times.
Apparently people use metronomes to start off slow so they can learn to lookahead,
and gradually speed up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This reminds me of a quote I heard:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meaning that to go fast, first you need to be smooth.
And to go smoothly, you need to go slow.
Makes sense, and for this type of application, it sounds like a very appealing idea
(although I hate metronomes).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="f2l_algorithms">F2L algorithms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up until now, I&#8217;ve only focused on intuition and have not learned any algorithms for F2L.
I looked through a couple of websites, and they just didn&#8217;t appeal to me.
However, I did learn today about rotating (hiding) edge pieces into slots,
and moving corners over to build pairs.
Earlier, I was only focused on hiding corners and moving the edges around.
Just never thought about it, but yeah it&#8217;s faster in those cases where it can be used.
So I might focus on learning at least a few F2L algs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="non_cube_rotation">Non cube rotation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another idea which we talked about was learning to insert pairs in all 4 slots without
cube rotations.
This is probably going to be hard, since I&#8217;m weak with left hand moves.
But I guess the point is to work on weaknesses to improve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My thinking is the hardest will be lookahead, so I will probably start with that.
When it gets too hard, maybe take a break and look at the other two.</p>
