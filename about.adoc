Started off as a game programmer (my dream job) right out of school,
but got disillusioned after a few years and ended up getting out of the industry.
After over a decade of soul crushing project management and non-technical work,
I finally got back to programming, with the realization that this is what I want to do.
(Even if it means working on business web apps).
Picking up after 10+ years of hiatus, there was a lot to catch up on.
It was and still is a lot to learn.

I'm keeping this blog to record things I learn along the way.  Not only programming and computers,
but anything which interests or excites me.
