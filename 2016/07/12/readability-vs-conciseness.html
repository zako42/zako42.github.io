      <h1>Readability vs. Conciseness</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I recently started going through the exercism.io ruby exercises.
The second exercise involves doing an element-wise diff between strings,
which represent nucleotides (made up of A,G,T,C).
I initially made a naive stab at it using each_with_index,
but it was a bit messy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I had to keep a local variable to increment the count of diffs:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="ruby"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="predefined-constant">self</span>.<span class="function">compute</span>(nucleotide1, nucleotide2)
  total_diff = <span class="integer">0</span>
  nucleotide1.chars.each_with_index <span class="keyword">do</span> |char, index|
    total_diff += <span class="integer">1</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> char != nucleotide2.chars[index]
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
  total_diff
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I found Array::zip.
This method takes two arrays and "zips" them together (think of a zipper).
The return value is an array where each element is an array of values with the same index.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="ruby">[<span class="integer">1</span>,<span class="integer">2</span>,<span class="integer">3</span>,<span class="integer">4</span>].zip([<span class="integer">5</span>,<span class="integer">6</span>,<span class="integer">7</span>,<span class="integer">8</span>])  <span class="comment"># returns [ [1,5], [2,6], [3,7], [4,8] ]</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this, you can map the results with a comparison to get the output needed.
When applying this to the method above, it becomes:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="ruby"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="predefined-constant">self</span>.<span class="function">compute</span>(nucleotide1, nucleotide2)
  nucleotide1.chars.zip(nucleotide2.chars).map{|a,b| a != b ? <span class="integer">1</span> : <span class="integer">0</span>}.reduce(<span class="symbol">:+</span>) || <span class="integer">0</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This brings me to the problem of <em>readability vs. conciseness</em>.
Both implementations return the same values (tests all pass for both).
I&#8217;d argue the first is easier to grasp,
but it&#8217;s longer and uses a local variable so it doesn&#8217;t seem as clean.
Sometimes we get caught up in refactoring,
trying to remove lines of code, stripping away as much as possible.
I know at work we&#8217;ve ended up with methods like the second one above when we&#8217;ve refactored overzealously.
But is it better to have a convoluted one line method, or a method which is easily readable?
Generally speaking, I like to keep things simple, so I prefer the first.
It does irritate me a bit that it&#8217;s not as clean,
but if I had to come back to it later,
I think I&#8217;d grasp what&#8217;s going on much faster.
Maybe this will change if I get more accustomed to the zip method,
and map/reduce type of operations.
But for now in my current level, the first seems more straightforward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m going to submit the first method and see what kinds of solutions others have come up with and
what kinds of comments there are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
ok after the post was written,
it was suggested in the exercise comments that I look at Ennumerable.
I had only looked at the Array methods, so I looked at Enumerable and found the method count.
This makes it much more readable:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="ruby">nucleotide1.chars.zip(nucleotide2.chars).count{|n1_val, n2_val| n1_val != n2_val}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think this is best of both worlds.
Exercism is a great site for learning.
Thanks to the people who contribute there!</p>
