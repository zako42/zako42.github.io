I was installing an Ubuntu 16.04 VM in virtualbox in Windows the other day.
When trying to create a new VM, there is a drop down box which allows you to select the guest
OS you will use.
I had the 64 bit iso for 16.04, but it didn't show up as a selectable option.
After looking this up, I found there were three requirements for 64 bit guest OSs:

. Host OS must be 64 bit (which it was)
. For Windows, Control Panel > Windows Features > Hyper-V must be disabled,
  as it interferes with the Virtualbox hypervisor for some reason
. Intel Virtualization and VT-d must be enabled in the BIOS

In my case the third requirement was not met.
The settings were turned off for some reason in my work laptop.
After turning them on, Virtualbox was happy and 64 bit OSs showed up in the menu.
