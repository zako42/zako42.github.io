I decided to resurrect my blog after I found out about the Jekyll Asciidoc Quickstart project.
The project gets you set up to where you can use asciidoc to write posts using Jekyll and publish on Github Pages.
This was exciting to me because I recently started using asciidoc and I love it.
Will write more about asciidoc on a future post,
and will also write up my experience setting up everything.
For now, I need to take my old blog posts and refactor them for asciidoc.
When that's done, I plan to write more frequent, smaller posts.
