== Just a few features of asciidoc format

* Everything is plain text, so we can use git, vim, other programming tools
* Superset of markdown, so we have backwards compatibility
* Auto table of contents
* Easy cross reference links, and section headings like <<Cool features of asciidoc format>> are all automatically linkable
* documents can include other documents
** this means we can extract partials to DRY them up between documents
** can adjust the indent level of sections within an included document.
This means each document can stand on its own, as well as become a section in another.

.Tables are easy too
|===

|Column 1 Name |Column 2 Name |Column 3 Name

|data 1
|data 2
|data 3

|row 2
|some other stuff
|more stuff

|===

* includes font awesome and all its icons icon:hand-spock-o[]
* if you want to style something monospace for code or commands inline, you can do so `like this`
* or you can enter a block of stuff

 like
 this

* block quote formatting is nice

[quote, me just a little while ago]
block quote formatting is nice

* admonitions are awesome!

NOTE: This is a note

IMPORTANT: This is important

* and of course, adding code blocks easily -- with callouts
