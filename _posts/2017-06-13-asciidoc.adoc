== Cool features of asciidoc format

* plain text, so we can use git, vim, other programming tools
* superset of markdown, so we have backwards compatibility
* auto table of contents
* easy cross reference links, and section headings are all automatically linkable
* documents can include other documents
** can extract sections to DRY them up between documents
** can adjust the indent level of sections within an included document. This means each document can stand on its own, as well as become a section in another.
* easy tables support
* include font awesome and all its icons
* admonitions!
* block quote formatting is nice
* support for math equations like Latex
* support for text specified diagrams

NOTE: this is a note

IMPORTANT: this is an important admonition
