== Just a few cool features of asciidoc

* Everything is plain text, so we can use git, vim, other programming tools
* Superset of markdown, so we have backwards compatibility
* Auto table of contents
* Easy cross reference links, and section headings are all automatically linkable
* Documents can include other documents
  ** this means we can extract partials to DRY them up between documents
  ** can adjust the indent level of sections within an included document.
     This means each document can stand on its own, as well as become a section in another.

.Tables are easy too
|===

|Column 1 Name |Column 2 Name |Column 3 Name

|data 1
|data 2
|data 3

|row 2
|some other stuff
|more stuff

* Includes font awesome and all its icons icon:hand-spock-o[]
* If you want to style something monospace for code or commands inline, you can do so `like this`
* Or you can enter a block of stuff

 like
 this

* Block quote formatting is nice

[quote, me just a little while ago]
Block quote formatting is nice

* Admonitions are awesome!

NOTE: This is a note

IMPORTANT: This is important

* And of course, adding code blocks easily -- with callouts

.Ruby example
[source, ruby]
----
class Dog
  attr_reader :name # <1>

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name # <2>
  end
end
----
<1> creates a getter method for the name instance variable
<2> sets instance variable
