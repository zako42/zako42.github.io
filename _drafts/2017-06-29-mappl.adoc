= I got funded

At work we have a mechanism for creating proposals which can get funded to become a project.
They're limited in the amount of funding they can receive,
but it's still a good opportunity to get to work on something you came up with and try to make a difference.
The process is kept very simple, to encourage innovation.
Basically you require a poster-like page with details,
and have to give a 15 minute pitch to a review board.
The turnaround is very quick.
I gave my pitch yesterday, and just got funded today to work on a project called MAPPL.

It's not really my project, it was envisioned and created by others at my office.
But I had the opportunity to present the proposal to the approval board (like Shark Tank), and went with it.
