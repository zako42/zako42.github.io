Started off as a game programmer (my dream job) right out of school, but got disillusioned after
a few years and ended up getting out of the industry. After over a decade of soul crushing project
management and non-technical work, I finally got back to programming, working on business web apps.
Having no background in web development or business programming, I'm starting almost from scratch.
Drinking from the firehose from the start, encountering impostor syndrome, and being old
in an industry of the young, it's all a bit intimidating.

I'm keeping this blog to record things I learn along the way.  Not only programming and computers,
but anything which interests or excites me.
